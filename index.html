	<h1> About </h1>

	<div class="long text"> Computer Science graduate turned associate software engineer. Lover of all things tech. Keen gamer (ask me how much I love Street Fighter) and e-sports enthusiast. I love to travel and want to see as much of the world as I can - this has triggered an interest in amateur photography. <br> <br>
The rotational graduate scheme at YNAP has given me the chance to develop a wide range of technical skills in front and back-end development. I spent my first 6 months working as a front-end web developer where I was exposed to JavaScript, Java, JSP, SASS/CSS. I am now part of a backend team that create RESTful API services for the rest of the company. Exposures include: Java (Spring Boot), Python and AWS. I am now moving into my third technical team where I will be joining the in-season mobile development team, where I will be learning Swift and Objective C. <br> <br> </div>
